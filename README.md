## 1. overview ##

mBus is a lightweight messaging system providing communication between daemons 
and applications. enabling development of component based distributed
applications.

every daemon registers with a unique namespace and a set of procedures with
various number of arguments under the namespace. procedure request and responce
are in JSON format. any daemon can post an event under registered namespace
with various number of arguments in JSON format. any daemon or application can
subscribe to events with namespaces and can call procedures from other
namespaces.

mBus consists of two parts; a server and client[s]. server interface for other
daemons/applications to register themselves, send events and call procedures from
other daemons/applications.

all messaging is in JSON format, amd comminucation is based on TLV (type-length-value)
messages.

mBus framework has built in applications; controller, listener, cli and a launcher.
controller is a very simple implementation of server and is the hearth of mBus.
listener is to listen every messages generated by either server or clients, and
usefull for debug purposes. cli is for generating an event, or calling a procedure
from connected clients. launcher is an helper application for those want to build
distributed applications framework.

mBus client library (libmbus-client) is to simplify development of software using mbus
(connecting to it).

mBus is using cJSON library (http://cjson.sourceforge.net/) for JSON operations, thus
heavily depends on it. mBus comes with built-in cJSON, and may externally linked if desired.
